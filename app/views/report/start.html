      <p>The Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) will only investigate cases where the misconduct is serious enough to potentially result in a prohibition order, meaning the person can no longer teach.</p>

      <p>Youâ€™ll need proof to support your allegation.</p>

      <p>Cases of less serious misconduct, and all cases of incompetence, should be dealt with by employers.</p>
