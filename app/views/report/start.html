      <p>The Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) will only investigate cases where the misconduct is serious enough to potentially result in a prohibition order, meaning the person can no longer teach.</p>

      <p>You’ll need proof to support your allegation.</p>

      <p>Cases of less serious misconduct, and all cases of incompetence, should be dealt with by employers.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long it will take to prepare your report</h2>

      <p>You should allow an hour or more to complete your report. The time it will take depends on the case. It will be faster if you’ve prepared the evidence.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">When to use a different form</h2>

      <p>If you want to make an anonymous report, or report multiple teachers at once, you need to <a href="#">complete a different form</a>.</p>
