  <p>Signed and dated documents are better than unsigned ones. If they were not signed at the time of being written,
ask the parties involved to sign and date a statement confirming their accuracy.</p>

  <p class="govuk-!-margin-bottom-6">Do not redact any of the documents. This will make it difficult to consider the evidence. All
information given is treated in strict confidence.</p>
