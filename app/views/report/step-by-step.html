      Report serious misconduct by a teacher in England: step-by-step
    </h1>

    <p>
      The Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) is responsible for investigating allegations of serious misconduct against teachers in schools in England. If necessary, it can stop individuals from teaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is how to report serious misconduct to TRA. There’s a different process if you’re in <a href="#">Wales</a>, <a href="#">Scotland</a> or <a href="#">Northern Ireland</a>.
    </p>

    <p>There’s separate information about <a href="#">what to expect if you’re a teacher who has been accused of serious misconduct</a>.</p>

          <p>If you’re a member of the public, complain to ​​the school, school governors or your local council before making a formal complaint to TRA.</p>

          <p>If you’re not satisfied with the response to your informal complaint, or you think the misconduct is serious enough that the person should no longer teach, check if the complaint can be dealt with by TRA.</p>
          <p>Serious misconduct is unacceptable behaviour that:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>falls significantly short of the standards expected of a teacher</li>

          <p>You can use the <a href="/report/start">Report a teacher for serious misconduct service</a> or complete and return a downloadable form. There’s a <a href="#">form for employers</a> and a <a href="#">form for members of the public</a>.</p>

          <p>You’ll need to provide evidence.</p>

          <p>Once TRA have reviewed the report, they’ll let you know what happens next. TRA could tell you they:</p>

            <li>need more information to decide whether to investigate the case</li>
            <li>will not investigate the case because it’s outside their remit</li>

            <li>will launch a formal investigation</li>

          <p>TRA might also consider imposing an interim prohibition order. This prevents the individual from teaching until the case has concluded.</p>

          <p>TRA will share the allegations with the teacher and ask them to respond. They might also appoint a legal firm to help with the investigation.</p>

          <p>If the teacher admits to the allegations, they can ask to have their case heard at a meeting instead of a hearing.</p>

          <p>Once the deadline for a response from the teacher has passed, a TRA decision maker will consider the case. They’ll take into account all the evidence, including information from previous employers or the police.</p>

          <p>If TRA believe a prohibition order could be made, they’ll arrange a professional conduct panel meeting or a hearing. The panel is made up of 3 independent people who are not employed by TRA or the Department for Education (DfE).</p>

          <p>If there’s a meeting, the panel will meet in private to consider the case, assisted by a legal adviser. There are no witnesses and the presenting officer and teacher do not attend.</p>

          <p>A <a href="#">public notice of a meeting is published on GOV.UK website</a> one week in advance.</p>

          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If there’s a hearing</h3>

          <p>Hearings are attended by:</p>

            <li>panel members</li>

          <p>If the professional conduct panel makes a finding of serious misconduct, they’ll make a recommendation about whether a teacher should be prohibited. The final decision is then made by a senior TRA official.</p>

          <p>The person who submitted the original report will normally be informed in writing within 2 working days of the decision being made.</p>

          <p>If there’s a finding of serious misconduct, <a href="#">a document summarising the outcome will be published online</a> within 2 weeks.</p>

          <p>Teachers have 28 days to appeal prohibition orders made against them.</p>
