    <p>The Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) will not deal with cases relating to minor misconduct, or a teacher’s performance or competence.</p>

    <p>You should:</p>

    <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
      <li>talk to the school or sixth-form college first to try to solve the problem.
</li>
      <li>contact the school’s board of governors or contact the council if you’re not happy with the response.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>You’ll need to provide proof to support your complaint.</p>
