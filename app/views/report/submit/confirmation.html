    <p>We’ve sent you a confirmation by email. Your confirmation includes a link to view your report.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>

    <p>Once the Teaching Regulation Agency (TRA) have reviewed the report, they’ll let you know what happens next.</p>

    <p>TRA could tell you they:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>need more information to decide whether to investigate the case</li>
      <li>will not investigate the case because it’s outside their remit</li>
      <li>will not investigate the case because it does not have the potential to result in a prohibition order</li>
      <li>will launch a formal investigation</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The time it takes for TRA to get back to you will depend on the case.</p>

    <p>For more information about what happens next, see our <a href="/report/step-by-step">step-by-step guide</a>.</p>
