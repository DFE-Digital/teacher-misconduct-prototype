      <p>There’s a legal process for referring serious misconduct by a teacher in England.</p>

      <p>You’ll need to follow these steps:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
        <li>Report your concerns locally</li>
        <li>Check if TRA will deal with the allegation</li>
        <li>Report the teacher to TRA using this service (online or using the paper form)</li>
        <li>Wait to hear back from TRA</li>
        <li>If TRA decide to investigate, they’ll send a copy of the allegations to the teacher</li>
        <li>TRA will decide whether there is a case to answer </li>
        <li>A professional conduct panel meeting or hearing takes place</li>
        <li>TRA confirm the outcome of the meeting or hearing</li>
      </ul>
